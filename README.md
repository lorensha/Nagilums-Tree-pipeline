Monogenic diabetes is a rare form of paediatric diabetes caused by a variation in a single gene responsible for pancreatic β-cell insulin production. Dysfunction of 
these genes results in insulin suppression which in turn causes hyperglycaemic health conditions. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a sub-type of monogenic 
diabetes, presenting in age groups below 35. Roughly 2 – 5 % of diabetic cases are diagnosed as MODY, however, patient classification has revealed symptomatic cohorts that are undiagnosed. 
It is speculated that these cases are a result of unknown genetic variants. It is necessary to identify pathogenic variants responsible for MODY to avoid common misdiagnosis and provide specialized medical care.

Through the integration of genomics and proteomics, the field of proteogenomics allows for the identification of alternative forms of proteins resulting from genomic variation. Then, spectra acquired by mass-spectrometry are matched to a sequence database, yielding peptide spectrum matches of different levels of confidence. However, discriminating between variant and canonical peptides remains challenging due to similarities between the sequences.
To this end, a classifier system is designed in this work to process a PSM dataset using the target-decoy approach.

The script files provided here are written in Python using PyCharm v3.10. 
The classifier enacts a machine learning base learner created using the Scikit-learn library (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 

Three implementation tasks are incorporated into this pipeline using the same classifier system and different statistical inferences and graphical visualisation methods. Details of this method are explained in the MSc thesis entitled: ""

A brief description of the tasks are provided below:
